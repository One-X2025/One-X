# OneX Genesis Configuration

This folder contains the genesis configuration for the OneX blockchain network.  
The `genesis.json` file defines:

- Network chain ID
- Genesis timestamp
- Initial block reward
- Halving schedule
- Total token supply (20 million ONEX)
- Initial account allocations (institutional wallet: 5M ONEX)

Modify `accounts` and `validators` as needed before launching the mainnet or testnet.
